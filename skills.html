      <h3> USER RESEARCH </h3>
      <div id="my-div">
        <p>I have developed a strong set of UX research skills over the years, which I believe would make me an asset to any team. At the core of my approach is a deep understanding of the importance of user-centered design. I believe that in order to create products that truly resonate with users, we need to be able to get inside their heads and understand their needs, goals, and pain points.

          To achieve this, I have honed my skills in a variety of research techniques, from surveys and interviews to usability testing and heuristic evaluations. I am comfortable working with both qualitative and quantitative data, and I know how to synthesize insights into actionable recommendations for design teams.
          
          One of the things that sets me apart as a researcher is my ability to think outside the box. I believe that the best insights often come from unexpected places, and I'm always on the lookout for creative ways to gather and analyze data. Whether it's conducting guerrilla user testing in a public space or using social media analytics to inform design decisions, I'm always willing to explore new avenues to gain a deeper understanding of users and their needs.
          
          Overall, my UX research skills are founded on a deep commitment to empathy, curiosity, and a desire to create products that truly make a difference in people's lives. Whether you're looking to conduct user research for a new product or optimize an existing one, I'm confident that I have the skills and experience necessary to help you achieve your goals.</p>
